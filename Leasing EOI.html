  <h2>Leasing Expression of Interest</h2>
  <p>The main factor that sets us apart from our competitors is that the entirety of our ingredients are South Australian grown and we take great pride in being purely locally sourced. We believe that our business will fit in perfectly in the Adelaide central market, due to the fact that it is different and introduces a new and creative business to the market. We believe that our product is going to sell well because we are aiming our products at the people that will want to buy locally and the smell of the freshly stewing jam will help to attract customers. We believe that our jam shop is the best fit for the central market as there are no shops like ours.</p>
  <p>Our commitment to 100% South Australian produce creates an eco-friendly environment around our business, as our carbon emissions are cut considerably with no use of trucks or planes and we endeavour to decrease our carbon emissions even more by implementing a fleet of electric vehicles for the transport of both our produce and products. We believe that this is a great selling point for our business as customers will feel like they are doing their part by not only buying a sustainably sourced and environment-friendly product but also supporting a small business.   </p>
  <p>We are applying for tenancy in Stall 39-40, this is a medium size stall perfect for our business. This stall is owned by ‘Big Table’, which has a very similar layout to our business. This would benefit us as the stall would already be mostly set up for us, meaning we could start trading sooner. We are predicting to open sometime in late May. The stall also has lots of seating around which will be useful for our tasting services. Stall 39-40 is quite close to the main entrance on Gouger St which would provide us with a lot of foot traffic.</p>
  <p>Our target market is very broad, mainly, but not entirely residing on middle age or elderly folk. This is because elderly people are more likely to properly appreciate our specialty Jam, and middle-aged folk are more inclined to shop for their relatives and our jams are the perfect present. Currently, we are projecting our marketing toward Facebook, Tiktok, Instagram and Pinterest (advertisments below) as we are currently trying to branch out to the younger generations which should hopefully bring in the next generation of customers to enjoy our delicious jams.</p>
  <p>Our employees wear a smart-casual navy blue apron with our logo on it, and the rest of the uniform is up to our employees, our only requirement is it has to fit in with our colourway which is a dark theme. We pay our employees generously, more than most stores in the Adelaide Central Market! Call us at 0481 964 345 or visit us in store to submit your resume and get working today!</p>
